This is a simple json api app that will be used to demonstrate backbone models and views.

## Setup

You will need to take the normal steps:

1. bunlde install
2. Create a .env file with a SECRET_KEY_BASE
3. Create the database, migrate and seed.

For the purpose of the exercises, pay attention to the files in ```app/assets/javascript/```.  Particularly, see how the files are included inside of ```application.js```.  Also, take note of the backbone setup in ```blog_app.js```.
